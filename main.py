"""
1. first_name, is a valid name in python, because it is snake case, which is when we use '_' instead of spaces between words.
2. 2nd_name is not valid because it starts with a number, it must start with a letter or underscore.
3. age is a valid name because there it is just a word but also it isn't predefined by python
4. total_amount is perfectly valid as well because it is using snake case.
5. while is not valid because it is predefined in python. Its specifically used for while loops, so it cannot be a valid variable name.
6. Student is also valid as well because it is just a word, however, we don't typically capitalize variables.
7. my-variable is not valid because it has a dash between the words which will return an error in python.
8. for, like while, has a predefined function in python dedicated to running for loops, so it is not a valid variable name.
9. _temp is valid because it uses snake case.
10. value# is not a valid name because #s are special characters.
